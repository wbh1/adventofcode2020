# Advent of Code 2020
Repo to track my Advent of Code solutions

### Why Python?
I have less time these days so I am going with quick and dirty (Python) vs what I truly love (Go). Gopher forgive me.

### Setup
Create a pipenv
```bash
pipenv install
```

 `cd` to any directory and run that day's Python file.
